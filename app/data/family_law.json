            "answer": "In Bangladesh, a wife's rights during divorce depend on her religion. Under Muslim law, a wife is entitled to: (1) Dower (Mahr) - both prompt and deferred, (2) Maintenance during the iddat period, (3) Custody of minor children subject to certain conditions, and (4) Any property or gifts given to her during marriage. Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist women have different rights according to their personal laws and recent legislation."

        {
            "question": "How can I file for divorce in Bangladesh?",
            "answer": "The divorce process in Bangladesh varies based on religion. For Muslims, men can pronounce talaq, but must notify the Arbitration Council and attempt reconciliation for 90 days. Muslim women can seek khula (divorce by mutual consent) or file for judicial divorce under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act. Hindu divorces are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act 2012. Christian divorces follow the Divorce Act 1869. All divorce proceedings should be filed with the appropriate Family Court."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the custody rights for children after divorce?",
            "answer": "In Bangladesh, child custody after divorce is determined based on the best interests of the child, though religious laws also influence decisions. Under Muslim law, mothers typically receive custody of sons until age 7 and daughters until puberty (hizanat), after which custody may transfer to the father. The Guardians and Wards Act allows courts to make custody decisions based on the welfare of the child, regardless of religious considerations."
